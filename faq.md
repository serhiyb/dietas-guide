## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I drink it cold or warm?

It's up to you. You can drink it cold or you can warm it up.

### Can I break the dieta earlier?

It's totally fine to break the dieta earlier. Listen to your body. If you feel exhausted mix some lime juice with water and salt and close the dieta.
Don't throw away the remaining tea bags with the plant. When you feel better you can make a tea out of it and drink it right before going to bed. 
The spirit of the plant might visit you in your dreams.


### I feel pleasant/unplesant emotions/sensations in my body.

That is the plant helping you. Don't resist and lean towards the sensations/emotions.

### Can I combine the dieta with Ayahuasca ceremony?

That is an excellent idea. Ayahuasca helps with establishing deeper relationship with the spirit of the plant.

One way to do it:
- Start the Master Plant Dieta on Thursday.
- Continue it on Friday along with the ceremony on Friday night.
- Do the final 3rd day of the Dieta on Saturday along with the ceremony at night.
- Sunday morning, after the ceremony, close the dieta.
- Sunday night do the 3rd ceremony. The spirit of the plant is still going to be in your body.
