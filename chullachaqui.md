One of the traditional Dieta protocols is described below.

#### Day 1

- At 5am drink half (one cup) of the prepared Chuluchaqui tea (the one that was sitting overnight).
- If your schedule allows, go back to sleep. Chuluchaqui often comes to us in dreams with their lessons and healings.
- At 5pm drink the second half of the Chuluchaqui tea and prepare the tea for the next day by following the same procedure: 
  - take two tea bags with the Chuluchaqui
  - put it into a pot and add two cups of water to it 
  - bring it to boil
  - reduce the heat to gently boil / simmer it for another 10 minutes
  - turn off the heat, cover it with a lid, and let it sit there overnight 

#### Day 2

Maintain the same dieta protocol as on the first day:

- 5am drink half of the tea. If possible, go back to sleep.
- 5pm drink the second half and prepare the tea for the 3rd day by following the same procedure.

#### Day 3

- 5am drink half of the tea. If possible, go back to sleep.
- 5pm take the last drink of the tea.


#### Day 4

When you wake up, it's time to close the dieta. 
Traditionally it is done by squeezing lime juice into a small amount of water, adding a pinch of salt, mixing it well, and drinking.
