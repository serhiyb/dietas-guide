![Ajo Sacha](/assets/images/small/ajosacha.jpg)

Amazonian indigenous people belive that Ajo Sacha (a.k.a "Wild Garlic") clears out impurities from the dieters energy body and infuses it with a pervasive light.
During the dieta it is common to get into relaxed meditative states.

The Ajo Sacha Dieta Kit package contains:
*   6 tea bags of Pau D'Arco
*   6 tea bags of Cat's Claw
*   6 tea bags of the Ajo Sacha

### Dieta preparation

2 days before the Dieta:
- drink Pau D'Arco and Cat's Claw tea. To prepare the tea:
  - put 3 tea bags of Pau D'arco and 3 tea bags of Cat's Claw into a pot and add 3 cups of water
  - bring it to boil
  - reduce the heat to gently boil / simmer it for another 10 minutes
  - turn off the hit and let it steep for another 10-15 minutes
  - drink hot or cold 3 times a day
- avoid alcohol and street drugs
- obstain from ograsms
- you can maintain your regular dieta during this preparation period

One day before the dieta around 5am in the morning take two tea bags with the Ajo Sacha and put them into separate cups (morning cup and evening cup). 
Add at least one cup of boiling water to each and let it sit for the next 24 hours.  

### Dieta

Dieta will last for 3 days. Recommendations for the dieta:

_Don'ts_:
- no salt, no sugar, no spices
- no orgasms
- reduce (ideally eliminate) any social interactions (including social media) - you want to spend as much time as possible 1:1 with the plant

_Do's_:
- you can eat:
  - oats, rice (white/brown), potatoes
  - cucumbers, avocado, broccoli
- focus on your interior, meditate
- draw, write, sing, play musical instruments
- do yoga
- take walks in the nature
- pay close attention to your dreams

One of the traditional Dieta protocols is described below.

#### Day 1

- At 5am drink one cup of the prepared Ajo Sacha tea (morning cup). Prepare the next morning cup by putting a new tea bag with Ajo Sacha and adding atleast 1 cup of boiling water.
- If your schedule allows, go back to sleep. Ajo Sacha often comes to us in dreams with their lessons and healings.
- At 5pm drink the second cup of the Ajo Sacha tea (evening cup) and prepare the next evening cup by following the same procedure as before.

#### Day 2

Maintain the same dieta protocol as on the first day:

- 5am drink the morning cup and prepare the next one. If possible, go back to sleep.
- 5pm drink the evening cup and prepare the next one.

#### Day 3

- 5am drink the last morning cup. If possible, go back to sleep.
- 5pm drink the last evening cup.


#### Day 4

When you wake up, it's time to close the dieta. 
Traditionally it is done by squeezing lime juice into a small amount of water, adding a pinch of salt, mixing it well, and drinking.
